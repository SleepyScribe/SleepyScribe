<p>Hello and welcome! I've currently started my journey in web development and various programming languages, and this
repo is to gather thoughts and small snippets to save for later. Keep in mind that this is a placeholder readme to
just explain a few things should you have randomly found yourself here.</p>

<p>Unless stated otherwise, the usage of anything you find here is open to use but not to claim. Some of this will be
my own projects and some will be some snippets I've recreated or copied from other areas. Whenever applicable, I
will provide links to videos and author webpages.</p>
